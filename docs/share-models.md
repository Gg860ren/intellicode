# How to: Share team completions in Visual Studio IntelliCode

IntelliCode has team completions sharing features that let you share any model you've created and automatically update users that have access when you retrain the model.

By creating a team completions model, you get IntelliCode completion recommendations for code that's not in the base model. Sharing a team completions model with collaborators extends the enhanced IntelliSense recommendations to everyone; they don't have to create or retrain a completions model themselves.

## Share a repository-associated team completions model

Repository-associated models are **automatically shared** with others working in the same codebase as long as users have enabled automatic acquisition of team models in Visual Studio. 

Enable automatic acquisition by going to **Tools** > **Options** > **IntelliCode** > **Acquire team models for completion**.

When anyone clones and opens the codebase the model was trained on, any completions models associated with the configured Git remote repositories will be downloaded and activated. If you are working on a fork of the codebase, simply add the upstream codebase as a remote repository to get the completions model.

Access to the repository is access to the model. When training, we collect some information about the checked-out commit. Anyone who requests that model must have the same commit in their repository and be able to produce the same information that was collected during training in order to receive the team model.

You can also share your model by going to **View** > **Other Windows** > **IntelliCode Model Management**, selecting your model from the left pane, and hitting the **Share** button. This generates a sharing link you can send to anyone you'd like to share the model with.

## Share a user-associated team model

After you've trained a model, the **Share model** button appears. Click the button to copy the sharing link. From there, you can share the link with your collaborators.

 > [!NOTE]
 > Anyone who has the sharing link can access the model and its suggestions, so make sure that everyone who receives the link is aware of this.

You can share your model with as many people as you like via the sharing feature. Team members can't retrain the model but they do see the same completion recommendations as you do.

## Add a user-associated team completions model

To use a model link that someone shared with you, follow these steps:

1. (Optional) If you're using a version of Visual Studio prior to Visual Studio 2019 version 16.1, first install the IntelliCode extension.

1. Open the IntelliCode page by choosing **View** > **Other Windows** > **IntelliCode Model Management**.

1. On the IntelliCode page, choose **Add model**. It's underneath **Shared With Me** in the left-hand navigation.

1. Paste the sharing link URL into the dialog box and choose **Add**.

   The shared model appears under **Shared With Me**. If you want to unlink the model, choose **Unlink**.

## Common sharing scenarios

This section describes how to set up model sharing for some common cases.

### Open Source project (git-based)

Suppose you have an existing codebase that contains good patterns for using types contained in a shared library. You'd like IntelliCode to learn from usage in that codebase to kickstart you and your collaborators when you start work on your next project that uses the same library. The new project, being new, has no usage to learn from. So what do you do?

The best approach here is:

1. [Train a model for team completions](custom-models.md#repository-associated-team-models) on the existing codebase.

2. Inform your teammates to enable automatic acquisition by going to **Tools** > **Options** > **IntelliCode** > **Acquire team models for completion** in Visual Studio 2019 version 16.1 or later.

When anyone clones and opens the codebase the model was trained on, any completions models associated with the configured Git remote repositories will be downloaded and activated. If you are working on a fork of the codebase, simply add the upstream codebase as a remote repository to get the completions model.

Access to the repository is access to the model. When training, we collect some information about the checked-out commit. Anyone who requests that model must have the same commit in their repository and be able to produce the same information that was collected during training in order to receive the team model.

3. Automate retraining your model with [the Azure Pipelines IntelliCode task](custom-models.md#automatically-create-and-retrain-a-model-in-azure-pipelines) to keep completions up-to-date with code changes. Your team automatically gets updates whenever the repo is trained. 

### Other sharing scenarios

If there are other sharing scenarios you feel are important, we want to hear about them. If you're using Visual Studio, you can [suggest a feature](/visualstudio/ide/suggest-a-feature) on Developer Community. If you're using Visual Studio Code, use the **Send feedback about** > **This page** button at the bottom of this page.
