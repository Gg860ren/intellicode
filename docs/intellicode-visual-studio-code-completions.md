# IntelliCode Completions Preview for Visual Studio Code

The [IntelliCode Completions extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioExptTeam.vscodeintellicode-completions) is an experimental extension which predicts up to a whole line of code based on your current code context.

This extension may contain unstable, experimental code. The IntelliCode team is focused on iterating rapidly and new functionality will be added.

### How to use

Completions will appear after your cursor as you type, with a faded color. At any time you can accept the suggestion by pressing the tab key (you will need to press it twice if the IntelliSense list is visible). If you don't want to accept the suggestion, you can just keep on typing or press ESC

When the IntelliSense list is open, its selection is used to inform the whole-line autocompletion.

To enable experimental support for JavaScript and TypeScript, search for `intellicodeCompletions.language` in the Settings menu.

### Installation
