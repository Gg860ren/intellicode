# IntelliCode Completions for Visual Studio Code

The [IntelliCode Completions extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioExptTeam.vscodeintellicode-completions) predicts up to a whole line of code based on your current context. Predictions appear as grey-text to the right of your cursor. This extension supports Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript.

For users of [C# Dev Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit), IntelliCode completions are available for C# in VS Code through a separate extension: [IntelliCode for C# Dev Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.vscodeintellicode-csharp)

## How to use

Completions appear after your cursor as you type, with a faded color. When the IntelliSense list is open, its selection is used to inform the whole-line autocompletion.

At any time, you can accept the suggestion by pressing the `TAB` key (you need to press it twice if the IntelliSense list is visible). If you don't want to accept the suggestion, you can just keep on typing, or press `ESC`.

### Snippet Completion

![Accepting a grey text completion with empty string automatically moves the cursor to the empty string](media/vsc-wlc-snippetcompletion.gif)

If the whole-line autocompletion includes empty strings:

1. The cursor automatically moves to the first empty string upon accepting the prediction with the `TAB` key.
2. If further empty strings exist within the prediction, pressing the `TAB` key again automatically moves the cursor to the next empty string.
